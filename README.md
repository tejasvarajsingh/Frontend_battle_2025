**About This Project**

I’ve put great effort into building this webpage and aimed to replicate the original design as closely as possible. While time constraints prevented me from implementing every single detail, I successfully incorporated most of the core features. Additionally, I introduced a few unique enhancements to improve the overall user experience:

1.	A **Ripple Effect** on every click anywhere on the page, adding a visually appealing interactive touch.
 
2.	A dynamic **“Next Event Countdown”** feature, commonly found on modern event-based websites.
  
3.	A **“Contact Us”** section at the bottom of the page.

Note: Some buttons or links might not work as this is only Front End.

I hope you find this project both useful and enjoyable to explore!
